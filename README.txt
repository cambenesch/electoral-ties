The code is in ssum.cpp. Within this directory, type `make` to create the executable. 
You can then run this executable with arguments. 

For instance, on my Windows box I ran the following in Git bash:
make
./ssum.exe <TARGET> < <INPUT-FILE>

The subset sum algos will run and, provided the inputs are valid, will print the results.
